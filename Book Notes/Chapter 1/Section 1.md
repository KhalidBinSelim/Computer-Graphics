**Computer Graphics** is a part of **computer science** that focuses on **creating images using computers**.

These images can be:

* **Very simple** → like drawing a triangle on a plain screen
* **Very complex** → like showing a realistic dinosaur in a forest

The main question is:
 **How does a computer create these pictures?**

Drawing on a computer is **different** from:

* Drawing with a **pen** (manual drawing)
* Taking a **photo** with a camera (capturing real images)

Because in computer graphics:

* Everything is created using **mathematics, algorithms, and programs**
* The computer calculates **shapes, colors, lighting, and positions** before showing an image

This chapter gives an **introduction** to the **basic ideas and concepts** of computer graphics and explains how they are connected.

The **goal** is:

* To help us understand **how computer-generated images are made**
* To prepare us to understand the detailed topics discussed later in the book
