## 1. Image Processing (vs Computer Graphics)

### Simple idea

The **main difference** between **image processing** and **computer graphics** is **where they start**.

### Image Processing:

* Starts with an **existing image**
* Works directly on **pixels**
* Produces a **new modified image**

Example:

* Changing every pixel to its **complementary color**

  * Black → White
  * White → Black
* Result: dark triangle on white background becomes white triangle on dark background

So:

> Image processing = **pixel-based manipulation of images**

---

### Computer Graphics:

* Starts with **object descriptions** (shapes, geometry, models)
* Generates images using **mathematics and algorithms**

---

### Relationship between the two

* They have **different goals**
* But they **overlap and support each other**
* Many impressive visual effects use **both techniques together**

---

## 2. Computer–Human Interaction (CHI / HCI)

### Simple idea

While computer graphics focuses on **creating images**,
**computer–human interaction (HCI)** focuses on **communication between humans and computers**.

Goal:

> Make interaction **easy, intuitive, and efficient**

---

### Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)

Computer graphics + HCI come together in:

* **Graphical User Interfaces**

Examples:

* Windows
* Menus
* Icons
* Buttons
* Cursor

---

### Input devices

Common physical devices:

* Keyboard
* Mouse

A **single physical device** can act as **different logical devices**.

---

### Logical devices (important for exam)

#### 1. Locator device

* Used to **specify a position** on the screen
* Example:

  * Mouse pointing to a location
  * Cursor shows feedback

#### 2. Choice device

* Used to **select an option**
* Example:

  * Clicking a menu item
  * The selected item is highlighted
  * Exact cursor position is not important

---

### Key design challenge

The main challenge of HCI is:

* Designing **interactive systems**
* That use graphics and devices effectively
* So they are:

  * User-friendly
  * Intuitive
  * Efficient

---

## Key Exam Points (Must Remember)

* **Image Processing** → works on pixels of existing images
* **Computer Graphics** → creates images from object models
* **HCI** → improves interaction between human and computer
* **Locator device** → specifies position
* **Choice device** → selects an item

---

## One-Line Exam Answers

* **Image processing** modifies images using pixel-based operations.
* **Computer graphics** generates images from geometric models.
* **HCI** focuses on effective communication between users and computers.
* A **mouse** can act as both a **locator** and a **choice** device.
